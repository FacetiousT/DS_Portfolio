    "For a succinct definition of recommendation engines, I will reference the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>A recommendation engine, also known as a recommender system, is software that analyzes available data to make suggestions for something that a website user might be interested in, such as a book, a video or a job, among other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "(https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/recommendation-engine)\n",
    "</blockquote> \n",
    "\n",
    "In researching various methods of building recommendation engines, I found a common pattern that seems to apply to <i>most</i> machine learning methods.  First, clean the data and get every unique entity at the row level, such as a unique dataframe/table of customers.  Next, encode features for each entity and compute the similarity of each entity--typically you create a similarity matrix in this step.  Finally, query the matrix based on a single user's or item's attributes and output the most-similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when building a simple user-based product recommendation engine, a quick recipe might be:\n",
    "1. Gather user data into a single dataframe of unique users, including behavioral variables and contextual\n",
    "2. Enrich user data, if possible, e.g., add social profile variables or user segmentation or recent purchases\n",
    "3. Encode/engineer user features\n",
    "4. Compute similarity of all unique users some in recent history\n",
    "5. Take a user, query similar users and see which items they bought that user has not purchased\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, more sophistication can be added to the above, including combining recommendation results and deploying in a fashion similar to below.\n",
    "\n",
    "An actual deployment plan might look something like the following:\n",
    "1. Build a data pipeline - extract, transform, and load data at regular intervals, perhaps daily\n",
    "    - transform data into a format that can be easily fed into a machine learning algorithm / wrapper\n",
    "2. Create a regularly scheduled task that ingests fresh user data then builds and deploys a new recommendation model\n",
    "    - automated script takes model wrapper parameters and generates a new similarity matrix\n",
    "    - script also evaluates and records model quality\n",
    "3. Tag certain web pages with JavaScript that encodes and compares user with the current recommendation build\n",
    "4. Once task 3 is complete, output inventory recommendations in HTML based on similarity computations.\n",
    "5. Gather further feedback from actual users and QA"

    "- <b>Collaborative Filtering</b>: aka 'social filtering', recommending actions/items based on similar past actions of a user\n",
    "- <b>Content-based Filtering</b>: recommending actions/items that are similar to other actions/items based on static attributes\n",
    "- <b>Similarity Matrix</b>: (typically) a correlation table that shows the similarity measures between all known entities, e.g., a user-user similarity matrix would show how similar every user is with every other user.\n",
    "- <b>The \"Cold-start\" problem</b>: when there is not enough data to draw inferences about a user or entity <b>yet</b>\n",
    "- <b>Pearson Correlation</b>: measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors, ie., comparing numerically encoded attributes\n",
    "- <b>Cosine Similarity</b>: another measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors \n",
    "- <b>Vector</b>: an array of attributes, independent variables, typically associated to a user, class, or item, encoded numerically as features (this is a common term in all ML)."

This result set is pretty great in some ways: we see that genre in this dataset IS a somewhat good indicator of similarity, by itself.  This content is well-labeled in some ways, some of these movies would probably please a movie watcher who likes Toy Story.  In other ways, not so much: we see that the top 10 movies here all have the same similarity score, if we had more features this would be very unlikely, our engine believes these movies are all equally similar, which is debatable, esp. since one is actually another Toy Story movie and is probably intuitively more-similar than Space Jam, for example.\n",
